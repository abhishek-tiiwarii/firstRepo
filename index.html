                <li><span>13/08/2020</span> - The day when this girl started her Engineering journey in Banasthali Vidyapith.</li>
                <p>Well she has always been an achiever and managed to maintain super awesome GPAs of 8.9, 9, 9.2 and so on throughout. But as the placement season was approaching she got demotivated and kinda desperate for a job each day. Got some rejections as well in the process, and there I Abhishek found a very good friend in her. Well it's her website so lets talk about her and not me <i class="fa-solid fa-face-grin-beam" style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffc400;"></i></i></p>
                <li><span>13/09/2023</span> - On  this day she got an offer from ZF India for the role of Engineer I. Very Happy.</li>
                <p>Now, it has all kinda ended on a successful note, time for celebrations and in the coming 3-4 months she got a boyfriend as well.</p>
                <li><span>25/01/2024</span> - The day she started her stint at NPL, New Delhi which continued till mid-May and officially ended in mid-June.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>26/06/2024</span> - This day will be memorable for holding the last exam for the B.Tech degree from Banasthali Vidyapith and the beautiful end to a beautifuller chapter, journey, whatever you say.</li>
                <p>Now it was all about the joining dates from ZF, and this is where her real patience got tested. Dates were supposed to be of July first week but the officials there kept it delaying due to some undisclosed reasons, and this girl was like, "Urghhh !!! Why are they doing this to me, to us??? Why God why??? <i class="fa-solid fa-face-frown" style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffc400;"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-face-angry" style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffc400;"></i>". She was extremely sad, furious, annoyed, surprised and whatever emotion you name. She felt everything during this whole period. And believe me it was not easy at all, but she handled those uncertainties very maturely. Strong girl, huhh!!</p>
                <li><span>04/10/2024</span> - Finally came the day when ZF reached out to her and she got to know that she is finally joining their organisation as an Engineer I in Hyderabad and believe me this was no less than the feeling which you get when you get to know you have made your first million, or you have become a parent, or the feeling when your parents say that they are super proud of you. And now we were like WOW it's getting real. Thanks a lot Bhagwan Ji <i class="fa-solid fa-hands-praying" style="font-size: 20px; color: rgb(250, 207, 176);"></i></li>
